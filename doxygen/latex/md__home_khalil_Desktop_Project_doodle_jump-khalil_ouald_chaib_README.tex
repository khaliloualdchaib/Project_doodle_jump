Game Description
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The goal of the game is to go as high as possible.
\item You can only move left and right and the player jumps without any user input.
\item There are bonuses that give you a jump boost.
\item There are 4 types of platforms\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Static platform (green platform) \&\#8594; these are just normal platforms.
\item Temporary platform (white platform) \&\#8594; after jumping once on these platforms, it will disappear.
\item Horizontal platform (blue platform) \&\#8594; these platforms keep moving horizontally across the whole window.
\item Vertical platform (yellow platform) \&\#8594; these platforms keep moving a certain distance vertically.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item A player can move left or right through the window and will then spawn on the opposite side.
